  "readme": "#nodebb-widget-teamspeak\n\nThis plugin for NodeBB allows people to put a configurable widget on their website which shows their Slack server's details.\n\n##Installation\n\nTwo options:\n\n 1.  Install the plugin through the ACP (if it ever gets added to the list *cough cough*)\n 2.  Run `npm install nodebb-widget-slack-users` in the root directory of the NodeBB install\n\nDon't forget to restart after installing the plugin. After installing, a new Slack widget should appear next to the rest\n\n##Configuration\nAll one must do is, in the NodeBB Admin area, go to Themes > Widgets, drag the widget wherever you want, and configure the options for the widget.\n\n##Features\n* Show how many users are online in the Teamspeak server\n* Can be themed easily\n* Shows the server info and a click on the title or link will open the Teamspeak server in the client\n* Can show the full channel tree, and users can be themed by server group, and channels can be themed by channel type\n\n## Suggestions? Encountered a Bug?\nPlease submit all feature requests and bugs with the [Issue tracker at Github.](https://github.com/sunsetbrew/nodebb-widget-slack-users/issues) Thanks\n",
